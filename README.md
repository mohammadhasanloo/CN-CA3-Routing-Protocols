# CN-CA3-Routing-Protocols
The purpose of this project is to familiarize with routing protocols in the network. In this project, which we did with C++ language, we implemented `distance vector` and `link state` algorithms and compare them.

You can test with these commands:
```
topology 1-5-6 1-7-7 2-7-13 2-6-2 3-7-1 3-8-4 3-12-8 4-10-11 4-6-19 5-10-3 6-8-17 6-11-25 6-13-4 7-12-8 8-11-16 9-12-5 9-13-7 10-12-12
